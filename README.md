# Understanding_Linear_Regression_Python
### Inspired by discovering that python could be a data visualization tool, I embarked on searching for a library that performs the function. This lead to the discovery of Matplotlib which I have used to visualize a linear regession of student performance vs hours studied. 
### Despite using structured data, it lead to further studying into how I could clean the data to prevent redanduncies and also making predictions and evaluating my mean absolute error which turned out to be lower than my expectation.
